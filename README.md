## Key Projects

### Solo Project: Australia Fires
My end-to-end data analysis implementation showcasing:
* Systematic data acquisition and preprocessing methodologies
* Advanced statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
* Custom visualization development for complex data relationships
* Rigorous interpretation of statistical findings with business implications

I focused on the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires for my Solo Project, integrating spatial, temporal, and environmental dimensions. The analysis examines the relationship between climate conditions and fire activity in New South Wales, demonstrating how the data science techniques I've learned can illuminate significant real-world phenomena.

### Best Work Portfolio
My portfolio includes visualizations that demonstrate mastery of increasing complexity:
* Univariate visualization examining global CO2 emissions distributions
* Bivariate visualization exploring economic and political relationships
* Trivariate visualization revealing penguin morphological patterns
* Quadvariate visualization analyzing car performance metrics
* Spatial visualization mapping regional patterns across the United States

### Technical References & Documentation
* Comprehensive statistical method implementation guides
* R function reference documentation with practical examples
* Data visualization technique implementation with best practices

## Technical Stack

My portfolio leverages industry-standard data science tools and frameworks:

* **R** (v4.4.3+) - Primary statistical computing environment
* **Quarto** - Next-generation reproducible document framework
* **Git/GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
* **R Packages**:
  * `tidyverse` suite for data manipulation and visualization
  * Specialized statistical packages for advanced analytical methods
  * Geospatial analysis libraries for location-based insights

## Implementation Guidelines

To execute these analytical documents:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/username/portfolio-Zhijun1933.git`
2. Ensure R (v4.4.3+) and RStudio (2024.12.1+) are properly configured
3. Install required dependencies via `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "quarto", "knitr", ...))`
4. Open `.qmd` files in RStudio IDE
5. Execute via "Render" to generate publication-quality output documents

## Learning Journey

What began as basic exercises in R programming has evolved into sophisticated analytical work that integrates multiple dimensions of data science practice. My journey started with fundamental setup challenges—installing R and RStudio, configuring Git, and establishing a portfolio infrastructure.

The course's progression through visualization techniques—from univariate to spatial—provided a natural scaffolding for my skill development. Each new visualization type built upon previous concepts while introducing new dimensions of complexity.

Data wrangling modules transformed my understanding of the analytical process. Learning to reshape, join, and manipulate data revealed how structure fundamentally shapes analytical possibilities. The elegant grammar of dplyr and tidyr packages provided not just technical tools but conceptual frameworks for thinking about data transformation.

## Academic Context

This portfolio represents my work completed for the Introduction to Data Science curriculum at Mac-Stat112. The repository demonstrates my progressive mastery of statistical concepts, computational methods, and professional data science workflows.
