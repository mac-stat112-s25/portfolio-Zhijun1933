The scores range from approximately 850 to 1120 points, demonstrating substantial variation in performance. A notable bimodal pattern emerges with distinct peaks around 900 and 1050 points, reflecting fundamental differences between states where SAT serves as the primary college entrance exam versus those favoring the ACT. States with higher SAT participation rates typically exhibit lower average scores due to their more diverse testing population, while states with lower participation rates often show higher averages due to a more selective testing pool.",

This counterintuitive pattern strongly suggests the presence of confounding variables, particularly participation rates and regional differences in testing preferences. States that invest more in education often have higher SAT participation rates, which typically results in lower average scores due to a more diverse testing population.",

This variation might reflect differences in resource allocation efficiency or underlying socioeconomic factors that influence educational outcomes.",

In states with low participation rates, SAT-takers are predominantly high-achieving students specifically targeting selective colleges. Conversely, states with high participation rates include a broader spectrum of academic achievement levels, naturally leading to lower average scores but potentially providing a more representative measure of overall educational outcomes. This pattern is particularly evident in the violin plot, which reveals the changing shape and spread of score distributions across participation categories.\n\n\n8.7.3 Part c: Expenditure and Participation Relationship\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"SAT vs. Expenditure by Participation Rate\",\n       subtitle = \"Examining Simpson's Paradox in Educational Outcomes\",\n       x = \"Per Pupil Expenditure (thousands $)\",\n       y = \"SAT Score\",\n       color = \"Participation Rate\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.7.4 Part d: Simpson’s Paradox Analysis\nThe relationship between educational spending and SAT scores presents a classic example of Simpson’s Paradox, highlighting the critical importance of considering participation rates in educational outcome analysis. While the aggregate data shows a negative correlation between spending and SAT scores, examining the relationship within each participation rate category reveals a positive correlation between spending and scores. This paradox occurs because states with higher educational spending typically have higher participation rates, which naturally correlates with lower average scores due to the broader testing population.\nThe participation rate serves as a crucial confounding variable that explains the seemingly counterintuitive negative relationship in the aggregate data. This finding demonstrates how aggregate statistics can mask more nuanced relationships in educational data and emphasizes the importance of controlling for participation rates when evaluating the effectiveness of educational spending. Understanding this paradox is essential for policymakers and educators in making informed decisions about resource allocation and interpreting educational outcome data accurately.",
